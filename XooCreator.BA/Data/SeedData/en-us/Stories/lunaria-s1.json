You, Puf-Puf, and the black rabbit step through. At the other end, a market square with crescent-moon flags. The Rabbit Council greets you. — \"Travelers from the Tree of Light?\" asks a councilor. — \"Puf-Puf, reporting,\" he says curtly. \"We're here to help.\" The council explains: \"A disease is weakening our people. We need solutions.\" The black rabbit, you, and Puf-Puf set off towards the White Mountain.",
