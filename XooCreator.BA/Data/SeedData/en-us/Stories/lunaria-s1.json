In you go: you, Puf-Puf, and the black rabbit. At the end, a square with crescent flags.\nThe Rabbits’ Council greets you. ‘Travelers from the Tree of Light?’ asks a councilor. ‘Puf-Puf, reporting,’ he says briefly. ‘We’re here to help.’\nThe council explains: ‘An illness weakens our people. We need solutions.’\nThe black rabbit: ‘I’ve heard of this, and I know what we can do! On Black Mountain there’s a mysterious monastery, and the monks there can heal any illness.’\nYou, the black rabbit, and Puf-Puf set off toward Black Mountain.",

I’m a Cat-Rabbit,’ she smiles.\nPuf-Puf nods: ‘I know, I once met a Cat-Rabbit, back in the cat–rabbit wars.’\nLinkaro: ‘The wars are over. I am the keeper of peace; I signed the last armistice. State your problem.’\nYou describe the illness.\nLinkaro: ‘You need the Stones of Life, with a healing essence. They’re under an exposed ledge. Gather them carefully.’",
