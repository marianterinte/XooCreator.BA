      "text": "Emperor Puf-Puf hasn’t repaired his ship, and as for Earth, he has no idea where it is in relation to Kelo-Ketis. He has heard, however, of a rare artifact: the Moon Lens. With it, the crystal enlarges the map and you can search deeper for the route to Kelo-Ketis. The target points to an area of low rocks and tall grass at the edge of a forest.",

I want to go home to Lunaria — do you promise to help?’ Now you know where Lunaria is: not the Moon, but a planet far from Earth. If we had a source of energy, maybe we could repair the ship together…",
