From their desperate embrace, the Tree of Light wove two spirits into a single body.\n\nThe Bunniraffe is a guardian of horizons. When it runs through the grass, the earth leaps with joy. When it rises to fight, shadows flee in shame. But its strength lies not only in speed or height, but in the friendship it offers to those who wander among the branches of the worlds.\n\nAncient spirits say the Bunniraffe will always be there where someone tries to mend what was broken, bringing courage and hope.",
