The city lights are just blurred spots; the walkways creak, the gears move jerkily.\nPuf-Puf lights the lamp on his collar.\n\n— Visibility: small to very small. Grubot, can you hear us?\nA short beep. Then silence.\n\n— We keep direction by the crystal's pulse, you say.\n— Under pipes, close to the railing, says the black rabbit.\n\nYou wander for a few minutes among pipes, rivets and cold steam, following the crystal's weak pulse.",

From the smoke, Grubot's silhouette takes shape.\n\n— I detected you by the crystal's signature and… a familiar chemical trace: Lunkarot, says the robot Grubot.\nPuf-Puf laughs:\n— Good digital nose.\n— A promise is a promise, continues Grubot. You gave me pulse; I give you vision. Follow me to the Control Tower.",

Upstairs, a colossus awaits you: the Mechanika-Magnus Telescope — tubes, mirrors, gears; the dome opens like a metal flower.\n\n— With this we're looking for my planet? asks Puf-Puf.\n— Normally it scans the city's routes, replies Grubot. But with the crystal adapter we can tune it to your planet's signature.\n— Then we mount it now, you say.",

Inside you can see an empty socket and thick coils.\n\n— We're missing two things, he says clearly:\n\na stone from Lunaria for the \"Green Eye\" — the piece that calibrates the spectrum;\n\nstored energy for the focusing coils.\n\n— We have a reservoir under the tower: charged, but unstable, adds Grubot.\n— If you have the stone, I mount it now; if not, we prepare the socket and stabilize the coils.",
