      "text": "A flash of light swallowed the ship and hurled it into a blinding whirl. The plasma lightning rods melted, the rudder jammed, and the hull slit the clouds before biting into the dry earth. When silence returned, the air smelled of dryness and scorching heat. \nPuf-Puf touched his scratched ear, looked at the towering trees andâ€¦ he didn't know where he was, where he had come from, or why. He only knew he had arrived in a strange place that stirred his curiosity.",

      "text": "On board, in the SOS module, an ancient crystal pulsed like a sleeping heart. \nPuf-Puf opened the panel, and the crystal's light projected into the air a map that seemed alive.\nBranches of light, paths that intertwined infinitely, some routes were dim, others sparkled like signs. \nThey all converged to a single node: the Tree of Light.",

      "text": "The Tree's leaves rustled like a whisper when Puf-Puf steps into your path and smiles as if remembering something, little by little. Puf-Puf \"-Hey, you. Yes, I'm talking to you. I'm Puf-Puf, a talking cat from the planet Kelo-Ketis... my ship is a bit crumpled, but my morale is still high. \nThe Tree brought us face to face and, honestly, you seem like the kind who knows what they're doing. I mean, you have that look like you've fixed two or three spaceships on Tuesday evening. \nCan you help me, please, to repair my ship and get back home? The crystal is the key. We have to decipher it.\nThe crystal seemed to project in a hologram, almost alive, a luminous tree, full of mysteries. ",
