Over there.\nThe black rabbit rotates his ears:\n— It's not a firefly. Sounds like a beacon.\nYou bend down and advance on two parallel rows, with short steps. In the ground you can see fine traces and a thin wire, half-buried. The ping returns: slower, then short again.\n— You stay on the left, says Puf-Puf. I enter from the right.\n— When you lift your paw, I stop, you say.\n— Exactly. We approach slowly, without touching the cable.",

Inside, a cracked circuit sizzles slowly and floats the smell of ozone.\nThe black rabbit pulls out a carrot and smiles:\n— On Lunaria, carrots don't repair robots.\n\n— Not directly, corrects Puf-Puf. But Lunkarot fiber — that special carrot from Lunaria — can serve as a jumper, and its juice cools the pathways well. It's about rhythm, not force.\n\n— Then we cut a thin fiber and drip slowly, you say.\n— Exactly, agrees Puf-Puf.",
